Credit Risk Analysis -
One of the leading banks would like to predict bad customer while customer applying for loan. This model also called as PD Models (Probability of Default)

Credit scoring is perhaps one of the most "classic" applications for predictive modeling, to predict whether or not credit extended to an applicant will likely result in profit or losses for the lending institution.There are many variations and complexities regarding how exactly credit is extended to individuals, businesses, and other organizations for various purposes (purchasing equipment, real estate, consumer items, and so on), and using various methods of credit (credit card, loan, delayed payment plan).

Most of the techniques use this sample to identify the connection between the characteristics of the consumers (annual income, age, number of years in employment with their current employer, etc.) and their subsequent history.
